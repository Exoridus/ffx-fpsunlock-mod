///     Particle retiming at the only place the engine separates advancing from drawing.
///
///     A particle program is a list of steps, and each step's descriptor carries up to two
///     per-object entry points: <c>+0x8</c> and <c>+0xc</c>. The dispatch in pppRunPartStd and
///     FUN_007170f0 calls whichever are present, once per object. The two are not variants of the
///     same thing - pppKeThSft adds constants into the object's position, angle and colour and
///     touches nothing else, while pppKeThDraw only reads the object and calls KeThCp_Draw. Update
///     and draw, in that order.
///
///     That is what makes this the one retiming that can work. Holding the pass, at any level above
///     this, takes the draw with it and the particles vanish on held frames - measured, twice.
///     Holding the update kernels alone leaves every draw in place: the objects simply do not move
///     on that frame, which is exactly what a 30 Hz animation looks like at 60 Hz.
///
///     The motion itself carries no time: the kernels add a constant per call. So there is nothing
///     to scale, and halving the manager's step reaches only the emission and lifetime timeline.
