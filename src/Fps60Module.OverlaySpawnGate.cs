///     The particle spawn cadence of the twenty magic overlays that carry a clock of their own, and
///     the only correction in this module that reaches them at all.
///
///     Every one of the 581 shipped overlays exports the same InitMagicPRX, which MagicFile_Start
///     calls with the address of gMagicFunctions and which copies 32 data slots out of that table
///     into DLL-local cells at load time. Slot 764 is the address of sg_count. Twenty overlays
///     actually read the cell they cached it into, three sites each, and every site is the same
///     shape: load the pointer, <c>test byte ptr [eax], 3</c> or <c>, 7</c>, skip the body when the
///     result is non-zero. The body allocates a particle and jitters it, so the gate is an emission
///     cadence of one particle every four or every eight counts. sg_count advances once per
///     presented frame, so at 60 Hz all twenty emit at double the authored density.
///
///     Nothing else here touches them. All twenty have a stub advance, so the effect advance hold is
///     a precise no-op for them, and the gates sit in the step kernels of the overlay's own draw-side
///     particle programs, which neither the particle kernel hold nor the timeline patch reaches.
///
///     The correction is a single pointer written into slot 764 before the first overlay is loaded,
///     so no overlay is modified and no other reader of sg_count changes. That the slot can be used
///     this way is a property of the image rather than a hope: the cell has no reference anywhere in
///     FFX.exe, the table has exactly one, and FFX.exe's own sg_count readers all address the global
///     directly.
///
///     The shadow counter deliberately does not mirror sg_count's value. The gates read three bits
///     and nothing compares them against anything else, so what matters is the rate, not the phase -
///     and an overlay's phase against a counter that has been free-running since boot is arbitrary
///     in the vanilla game too.
