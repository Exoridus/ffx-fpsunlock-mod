///     Replacing an FMV without touching the 20.7 GB archive, and without a detour on the file
///     layer.
///
///     <para>The path is data, not a literal.</para> PhyFMVPlayerManager keeps the full path of the
///     clip it is about to play in its own buffer at instance+0x4F0 - prefix and authored case
///     intact, <c>../../../FFX_Data/GameData/PS3Data/Video/OPL_us.webm</c> - and the playback entry
///     reads it from there. So one hook on that entry, which runs once per video, does what two
///     hooks on <c>BigFileStream::checkExists</c> and <c>openFile</c> did while answering for every
///     file the engine opens. Those two are what <see cref="FpsUnlockConfig.AssetOverride"/> still
///     installs and what crashed the process twice.
///
///     <para>The replacement is written as an absolute path, and that is the whole trick.</para>
///     It settles both unknowns at once. The archive hashes the path from
///     <c>stream_prefix_strlen</c> bytes in, so an absolute path is hashed from its ninth character
///     and cannot match any digest in the index - the archive misses by construction, with nothing
///     patched and nothing hooked. The engine's fallback then calls <c>CreateFileW</c> on that same
///     string, and an absolute path resolves the same whatever the working directory happens to be
///     at that moment, which a relative one does not: the launcher leaves the process in
///     <c>fahrenheit\bin</c> and nothing in the engine sets it back.
