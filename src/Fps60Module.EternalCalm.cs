///     The copyright card drawn over the Eternal Calm sequence.

///     Sg_MainLoop draws it inline, once per pass: it increments a frame counter, passes the new
///     value to ToDrawEternalCalmCopyRight, and then compares the counter against 0x130 to decide
///     whether the sequence is over. Both the counter and the card's alpha therefore advance once
///     per presented frame, so at 60 Hz the card fades in twice too fast and the sequence ends after
///     5 seconds instead of 10.
///
///     The card cannot simply be held, because a skipped call is a frame with no card on screen. It
///     is detoured instead: on a held frame the counter is put back where the caller found it and
///     the callee runs with the un-advanced clock, so the authored sequence is emitted at half rate
///     while every frame still draws.
