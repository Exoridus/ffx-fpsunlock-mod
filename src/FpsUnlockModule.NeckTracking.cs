/// <summary>
///     The head and neck tracking an actor runs while something has its attention: a weight that
///     ramps the override in and out, a yaw that blends towards whatever the actor is looking at,
///     and a fade that slerps out of the pose the previous target left behind.
///
///     All three are counted in calls and none of them reads sg_rate, so at 60 Hz all three run at
///     double speed. Two of them are not patchable even in principle: the yaw blend divides by 1.5
///     or multiplies by 0.25 out of shared .rdata constants that dozens of unrelated functions
///     read, and the slerp fade decrements by the same 0.25.
///
///     The call cannot be skipped. Its tail writes the replace matrix and the weight of optpos
///     element 9 - a pointer to the actor's own matrix at +0x46c, plus the weight - and the worker
///     runs Ch_CalcElement and Ch_OptposCalc over that element a few instructions later, so a frame
///     without the call is a frame drawn from whatever the element held before.
///
///     So the call runs every frame and its state is put back on the frames a 30 Hz game would not
///     have taken. Restoring after the fact is exact here, which it is not for the look-around next
///     door, because nothing in the body is random and nothing it applies survives into the next
///     call except through the fields that are restored:
///
///     <list type="bullet">
///     <item>The pose matrix at +0x46c is rebuilt from scratch every call - the normal path clears
///     it to identity and assigns the three basis vectors, the explicit-rotation path assigns it
///     from a unit matrix - so it never accumulates and does not need restoring. It must in fact
///     NOT be restored: Ch_NeckSetEnable snapshots it as the quaternion the next fade starts from,
///     and the pose that was actually drawn is the right thing for it to read.</item>
///     <item>The two element fields the tail writes are overwritten by the next call and read only
///     in between.</item>
///     <item>The three clocks and the side latch are the whole of the rest, and all four go back.</item>
///     </list>
///
///     The visible result is the engine's own sequence at half rate: on a held frame the call still
///     computes and applies the state one step ahead, and the following advancing frame recomputes
///     that same step from the restored state, so each authored value is drawn twice rather than
///     every other one being skipped. The recompute is not bit-identical, because the yaw blend
///     reads the target's position and the actor's facing afresh, but that is the input moving
///     under a 30 Hz clock rather than the clock itself running fast.
///
///     Ch_NeckSetSpeed needs no hook. It writes the divisor of the weight ramp, and scaling that
///     divisor would be the way to halve the ramp if the ramp were the only clock; holding the
///     state halves all three without touching a setter, and it leaves the two clocks whose rates
///     are shared constants correct as well.
///
///     Everything the hook needs lives in locals, so it is safe on the job threads Ch_CalcMain
///     dispatches this work to.
