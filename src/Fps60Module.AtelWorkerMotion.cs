/// <summary>
///     The ATEL worker's own motion and rotation, which is how every event character walks and
///     turns, how the field and event camera travels, and how an attached map group or map part
///     moves.
///
///     Each worker carries nine move records at +0x5b8, stride 0x4c, and nine rotation records at
///     +0x864, stride 0x44 - one per thread priority, reached through the thread's own +0x44 and
///     +0x48. Two readers step the current pair once per ATEL pass, which is once per presented
///     frame, and every quantity they advance is counted in calls rather than in time:
///
///     <list type="bullet">
///     <item>a yaw and a pitch turn step in radians per call, and four rotation rates;</item>
///     <item>two watchdog deadlines, compared against a counter each reader increments itself, past
///     which the step is multiplied by counter over deadline up to eight times;</item>
///     <item>a float interpolation accumulator advanced by one per call and divided by a duration,
///     which is how the spline, linear and parabolic move types and the timed rotation types
///     express their progress;</item>
///     <item>the actor's speed, integrated into its position once per call for every worker that is
///     not a Ch character.</item>
///     </list>
///
///     Nothing in the engine scales any of it. At 60 Hz an event character turns at twice the
///     authored angular velocity, a scripted rotation finishes in half its authored time while the
///     wait placed after it now runs twice as long, and the field camera dollies twice as fast.
///
///     Four corrections, and each one starts from the same test: a scale of one means the engine is
///     already pacing itself from the syncdata table, and then nothing here changes anything.
///
///     <para>The rates are divided at their setters.</para> Each is a leaf function with one caller,
///     its ATEL opcode handler, and the field it writes is the only place the value lives. Dividing
///     at the reader is not available: the rates are read at four statements across the two readers
///     and combined there with the watchdog multiplier and the rotation ramp's own ease weight, so
///     there is no single point to correct.
///
///     <para>The deadlines are multiplied at theirs.</para> Scaling only the step would leave the
///     watchdog firing halfway through every long turn and accelerating its second half; scaling
///     only the deadline moves a line that nothing crosses. The pair is what reproduces 30 Hz.
///
///     <para>The accumulator is corrected at the increment, not at the duration.</para> The
///     duration setters look like the obvious lever and are the trap in this cluster: startMotion
///     and startRotation overwrite the duration field with its reciprocal for half the types, so a
///     multiplication there silently becomes a division of a field nothing then reads, and the
///     linear move type takes its step from the FMV decoder's own frame index while a movie with
///     its own camera is playing, which is wall clock and already right. So the readers are wrapped
///     instead, and the accumulator is rewritten by the delta the reader was just seen to produce.
///
///     <para>The translation is corrected at the integrator.</para> Not at the speed setter: the
///     same field reaches Ch_SetSp for a loadModel worker, whose motion Ch_CalcMain already
///     integrates against a corrected delta, and halving it there would halve every event
///     character's walking speed on top of a correction that works.
///
///     Every hook keeps its state in locals. The readers run on the ATEL pass rather than on a
///     Ch_CalcMain job thread, but nothing here would care either way.
