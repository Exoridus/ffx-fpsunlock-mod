/// <summary>
///     A read-only probe over the field particle manager array, for the one diagnosis that cannot be
///     made from the counters the other subsystems keep.
///
///     Field particle groups vanish and come back, and two candidate causes are left. pppFpLoop
///     keeps a restart countdown at manager+0x00 which it decrements once per pass, with no time
///     term at all, and then tests the result: while the result is still zero or above the group
///     is skipped outright - not advanced, not drawn - and at -1 every object is freed and the
///     group is started again in the same pass as the decrement. That is a pass-counted duration,
///     so at twice the pass rate it elapses in half the wall clock time. The other candidate is
///     pppCheckViewCylinder, which is vanilla, camera driven and rate independent, and which
///     nothing in this module could have changed.
///
///     The countdown is what this reads, and the two end-condition flags beside it are what says
///     which kind of group is being looked at: _pppRunPartFp ends a group on its authored death
///     time when +0x1C is zero, and on an empty object list when +0x1C and +0x1D are both set. A
///     session in which every live manager reads -1 throughout eliminates the countdown and leaves
///     the view cylinder.
///
///     Draw-nothing, write-nothing. It reads engine memory and emits a log line; it holds no frame,
///     scales no step, and no correction reads any state it keeps.
