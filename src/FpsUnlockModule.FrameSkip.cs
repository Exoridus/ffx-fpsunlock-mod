/// <summary>
///     Reporting for the engine's own multi-pass counter, which is the one clock in this module's
///     reach that nothing else observes.
///
///     Every correction here assumes one Sg_MainLoop pass per presented frame, and that assumption is
///     the engine's default rather than its rule: updateFFX runs its whole body in a
///     <c>do { ... } while (gElapsedFrameCount_frameSkip != 0)</c>, so a frame that is behind runs
///     the simulation several times before it presents. During those extra passes the engine sets
///     gParticleDoNotRender and gFrameSkipDoNotRender, so they simulate without drawing.
///
///     The counter has to be read at the one instant it is meaningful. FUN_00821f90 computes it and
///     Sg_MainLoop consumes one pass of it immediately afterwards, and the loop only exits when it has
///     reached zero - so anything sampling from the present path reads zero every time, the way the
///     particle object counter does. It is sampled inside the vertical blank hook instead, right
///     after the original has run, which is between the write and the decrement.
