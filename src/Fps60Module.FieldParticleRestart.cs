/// <summary>
///     The field particle group restart countdown, which is a pass count with no time term.
///
///     pppFpLoop keeps one at each manager's +0x00. While it is zero or above the group is skipped
///     outright - not advanced and not drawn - and the countdown is decremented once for that pass;
///     at -1 every live object is freed and the group is started again through _pppStartPart. So the
///     stretch during which the group is absent, and the instant it comes back, are both measured in
///     passes. At twice the pass rate both happen in half the authored wall time, which is the
///     vanishing and popping in that field particles show at 60 Hz.
///
///     Two things arm it. pppSetFpPdt writes the group record's +0x30 into it when field data loads,
///     which is the staggered start; the five id-addressed calls (FUN_00729620, FUN_007297f0,
///     FUN_00729830, FUN_007298d0, FUN_00729900) write a plain 0, which is a restart latch that
///     fires on the next processed pass. FUN_007297f0 is on the ordinary gameplay path that attaches
///     a group to a character, so the countdown is re-armed during play and is not a load-time-only
///     concern.
///
///     The correction adjusts the counter and never gates the call. Gating is not available here:
///     pppFpLoop measures its draw packet as ppvCurPrimp - DAT_00cec210, the distance the write
///     pointer travelled during the loop, so the draw is built inside the advance and skipping any
///     part of it drops that group's contribution to the frame. Instead, on a frame this module
///     holds, one is added back to every armed countdown before the engine's own decrement runs, so
///     the pass nets to zero and the countdown advances once per authored 30 Hz step.
///
///     The add is undone again for any manager the engine did not in fact decrement. A group is only
///     decremented on the pass that reaches LAB_00729d1f, which needs it to be alive, not marked
///     display-off, and either carrying a non-zero fprim id or passing pppCheckViewCylinder - and
///     pppFpLoop returns before its loop entirely while g_FpLoopFlag is clear. Without the undo, a
///     group that is off camera while its countdown is armed would gain one per held frame for as
///     long as the camera looks away, and would then take far longer to appear than it was authored
///     to. Comparing against the exact value written is what makes that impossible: every other
///     writer of the field stores -1, 0 or 0xFFFFF000, none of which can equal it.
