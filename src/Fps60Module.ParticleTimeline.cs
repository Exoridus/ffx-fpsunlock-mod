/// <summary>
///     The particle system's own clock, and the only correction here that is a rate change in the
///     image rather than a hook.
///
///     Every particle object carries its age in fixed point at obj+0xc, and the dispatcher advances
///     it by a constant per pass. That age is the timeline: a step's keyframe fires when the age
///     equals the cursor's tag, the loop point and the death threshold are compared against it, and
///     the trail kernels index their history buffer with it. At 60 Hz it advances twice as fast as
///     it was authored for, which is why a campfire burns through its program in half the time.
///
///     Halving the constant is safe in a way a hold never is, and the reason is arithmetic rather
///     than luck. A keyframe fires on exact equality, so every tag that works today must lie in
///     {base + k * 0x1000}; halving makes the reachable set {base + k * 0x800}, a strict superset.
///     No keyframe can be missed. Everything else expressed in age units - the loop point, the death
///     threshold, the trail's "am I in the last pass" test, the negative age nudge that keeps an
///     object alive one more pass - is authored data in the same unit and stays correct in wall
///     clock time without being touched. Patching those "for consistency" would break them.
///
///     The manager's emission clock has to move with it. It advances by its own step per pass and
///     decides when the next object is spawned, so halving only the age would double the standing
///     population: the same spawn rate per frame against twice as many frames of life.
