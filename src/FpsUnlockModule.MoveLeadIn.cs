/// <summary>
///     The ten-pass lead-in that move type 9 waits out before it starts interpolating.
///
///     AtelWorkerMoveProc gates case 9 on the move record's own counter at +0x06 being below
///     worker+0xb16, and that counter advances once per pass. The threshold has exactly one writer in
///     the whole image, AtelInitBasicWork loading 10 into eax and storing it as a word, so it is an
///     engine constant with no ATEL opcode behind it: none of the four deadline setters this module
///     already corrects can reach it. At 60 Hz the wind-up therefore elapses in about 166 ms against
///     an authored 333 ms, and the object it belongs to sits still for the first half of it while
///     everything around it has already moved - which is a stutter immediately before the motion
///     rather than during it.
///
///     It is corrected as an image patch on the immediate rather than as a hook on the initialiser,
///     for two reasons. The catalog's calling convention for AtelInitBasicWork is Ghidra's default
///     and not a measurement, and a detour with the wrong convention on an init path is the failure
///     that cost this project four wrong hooks already; and the immediate is loaded once per worker
///     init, so patching it costs nothing per frame. The store is register-relative, so nothing in
///     the signature moves with the image base - the lesson of the battle cursor patch, whose first
///     version embedded a relocated address and silently refused on most runs.
