/// <summary>
///     Particle retiming. Every particle manager keeps a fixed-point time accumulator and advances
///     it by a per-manager step each frame, so unlike the frame-sequence systems particles carry a
///     rate that can be scaled rather than only held.
///
///     Two writers set that step and both have to be caught.
///
///     <c>_pppStartPart</c> writes its second argument into the manager's +0x10 when the manager
///     starts. Scaling the argument there covers every source of an initial step, including the
///     literal 0x1000 the magic path passes, which a write to the global would never reach.
///
///     <c>pppDataRcv</c>, which <c>pppPartLoop</c> calls at its end, broadcasts the global step into
///     every active manager's +0x10 again. That is the PS2 path: measured 2026-08-30 with the loop
///     hook attached, part_rescaled stayed 0 and the global step read 0, so the broadcast does not
///     run on PC and the start scaling is never undone.
///
///     Which leaves the step alone unable to fix the speed at all. <c>_pppRunPart</c> calls
///     <c>pppRunPartStd</c> before, and independently of, the accumulator update, so the
///     instruction pass runs once per call: particle motion follows call frequency, and the step
///     only moves the emission clock and the group's end. The frequency is addressed one level
///     down, per kernel, in <see cref="FpsUnlockConfig.ParticleKernelHold"/>.
///
///     Holding at this level was tried and is not available: the same call builds the draw packet,
///     so a held frame drops that manager's contribution and the effect flickers. That is why the
///     step here is scaled by the same integer divisor the object age is patched with, and nothing
///     above the kernels is ever skipped.
