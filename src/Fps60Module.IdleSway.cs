/// <summary>
///     The idle look-around an actor runs while it is standing still: a body-yaw offset that walks
///     towards a random target, dwells there for a few calls, and rolls a new target.
///
///     Every quantity in it is counted in calls. The dwell is rand() &amp; 3 + 1, so one to four calls;
///     the step is rand() % 0x14 + 1, so one to twenty tenths of a degree per call. Nothing in the
///     function reads sg_rate or KEEP_FPS, so at 60 Hz the whole look-around plays at double speed.
///
///     The call cannot be skipped. Its tail rebuilds the rotation of optpos element 0x0d from the
///     character resource - it assigns all three components rather than accumulating into them - and
///     Ch_OptposCalc consumes that element immediately afterwards in the same worker pass, so a
///     frame without the call is a frame whose element rotation nobody wrote.
///
///     So the call runs every frame and the advance inside it is suppressed on the frames a 30 Hz
///     game would not have taken. That is the copyright card's hold with one difference: there the
///     step is a constant, so letting the call advance and putting the state back afterwards shows
///     the next authored value one frame early and nothing else. Here the advance draws its next
///     target and step from rand(), so the value a held call would put on screen is not the value
///     the following advancing call produces - undoing the state would leave a visible one-frame
///     excursion of up to two degrees every time a re-roll landed on a held frame, which is roughly
///     one held frame in five. The advance is therefore prevented from happening at all, and the
///     apply block runs off the unchanged angle.
///
///     Two properties of the body make that possible without touching the code path itself. The
///     re-roll is gated on the dwell counter being zero, so any non-zero dwell skips it; and the
///     walk adds or subtracts the step and then only clamps when it has crossed the target, so a
///     step of zero writes the angle back unchanged and takes neither clamp. Both writes are undone
///     afterwards along with the two the call makes on its own.
///
///     Nothing outside this function reads the four fields, and everything the hook needs lives in
///     locals, so it is safe on the job threads Ch_CalcMain dispatches this work to.
