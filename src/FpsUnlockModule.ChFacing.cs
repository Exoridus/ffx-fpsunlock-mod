///     How fast a character turns to face where it is going. This is the largest per-call rate left
///     in the Ch subsystem and it applies to every actor in the game that walks, swims or stands
///     still: the two loop-1 motion controllers step the facing at <c>Chr+0x158</c> towards its
///     target at <c>Chr+0x168</c> by a constant number of radians per call, selected from three by
///     the actor's speed, and neither controller reads the delta the rest of loop 1 is handed.
///
///     <list type="bullet">
///     <item>standing, speed exactly zero: 0.31415921 rad, 18 degrees per call;</item>
///     <item>walking, speed at or below the threshold at <c>Chr+0x170</c>: 0.34906578, 20 degrees;</item>
///     <item>running, above it: 0.52359867, 30 degrees.</item>
///     </list>
///
///     At 30 Hz that is 540, 600 and 900 degrees per second. At 60 Hz it is all doubled, so a
///     character spins to its new heading in half the authored time while its translation, which the
///     corrected delta does reach, still takes the authored time. The visible result is an actor that
///     snaps round and then walks off, rather than turning into its walk.
///
///     The correction divides the three constants and nothing else. It is not a hold: holding the
///     facing would freeze turning on every second frame while translation kept running, which is
///     the reason the buoyancy hold deliberately leaves the same field alone.
///
///     <para>Patched at the six instruction operands rather than at the function or the data.</para>
///     The constants are not private to these two controllers. Each is an <c>fld dword ptr [abs32]</c>
///     out of a shared literal pool, and 0.34906578 has a third reader at <c>0x0082D70E</c> that has
///     nothing to do with actor facing - so writing the pool would retime that too. The alternative,
///     a detour on the step helper Sg_StepAngleTowards that the constant is an argument to, returns
///     its result in st(0) and has a third caller of its own in Ch_CalcElement, so it would need a
///     float-returning delegate and would also change a quantity nobody has looked at. Rewriting the
///     six operands to point at three floats this module owns changes exactly the six sites, keeps
///     the engine's own instruction stream, and lets the values follow a rate that moves.
///
///     Nothing in the verification is an absolute address, which is the lesson of the battle cursor
///     patch: each site is checked by its two-byte opcode, by the register-relative compare and
///     branch in front of it, and by the value the operand currently points at, read through the
