///     Halves what the eight generic integrators add per call, instead of skipping every second
///     call. Same wall-clock rate as the hold, but every frame carries a valid intermediate value.
///
///     <para>
///     The hold gets the average right and the image wrong. A held kernel leaves its object
///     untouched for a whole frame, so particle motion advances on 30 of 60 frames while the camera
///     advances on all of them - visible frame by frame as the particles and the camera moving in
///     alternation. Worse at the edges of a life: the death test runs off the object age, which is
///     scaled exactly and therefore tested every frame, while colour and scale are only updated
///     every second frame. An object can die with the alpha of the previous update still in place,
///     which is a particle vanishing instead of fading out, and it can be drawn for one frame
///     before the kernel that seeds its start value has run, which is one appearing at full
///     opacity instead of fading in.
///     </para>
///
///     <para>
///     These eight cannot be retimed by patching authored data: each one integrates a constant per
///     call - value += rate for the Move kernels, rate += acceleration for the Accele ones, from a
///     slot pair the program data names - and the constants are shared authored values. What can be
///     done is to let the kernel run and then keep half of what it did. That needs no knowledge of
///     which slot means what, it is exact for the float kernels, and it composes correctly across
///     the double integrators: the rate an Accele kernel produces is the same field a Move kernel
///     reads, so halving both makes the position error scale with the square of the timestep the
///     way it should, rather than with its square root.
///     </para>
///
///     <para>
///     The keyframe branch is untouched by construction. On a keyframe tick a kernel adds the
///     authored delta to the <em>rate</em> slot, not to the integrated slot, and only the latter is
///     corrected here - so a one-shot authored value keeps its full size while the per-call
///     integration is halved.
