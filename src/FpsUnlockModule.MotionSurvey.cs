///
///     FUN_00838d10 is where an actor's motion speed enters its frame accumulator, and it is the
///     only reader of sg_rate in the whole image. Three paths leave it:
///
///     <list type="bullet">
///       <item>flag 0x40 clear: the speed is scaled by sg_rate, but only when the actor also
///             carries 0x100000 and KEEP_FPS is set;</item>
///       <item>flag 0x40 set and the sign bit set: a separate accumulator at actor+0x740 that
///             wraps against a per-motion length, with no rate correction anywhere;</item>
///       <item>flag 0x40 set and the sign bit clear: the same speed computation as the first path,
///             again with no rate correction.</item>
///     </list>
///
///     So two of the three paths cannot be corrected by KEEP_FPS at all. The first is gated on a bit
///     Ch_Allocate sets on every actor and only ChEvent.setKeepFps clears, so an actor that reaches
///     the advance without it was opted out by a cutscene script rather than left out by its data.
///     The global half of the gate is the one that moves in practice: it is clear for whole scenes
///     at a time, and while it is, no actor is corrected at all. This counts which path each actor
///     actually takes, which is the measurement that was missing.
///
///     The counts alone say how many actors run uncorrected but not which, so each path also names
///     the actors that reach it, once per distinct identity rather than once per frame.
///
///     Naming them is still not enough to say what the uncorrected advance costs, because the
///     damage is a clip reaching the end of its portion early and stopping there, and a name says
///     nothing about where a clip is. So the uncorrected actors also get their motion record
///     sampled over time: clip position, clip end, loops left, running flag, speed and hokan
///     divisor, on a slow heartbeat plus every change of the running flag.

    /* Counts, and corrects the actors the engine's own rate correction does not reach.
     *
     * This is where the motion rate correction belongs, because this is where the engine takes the
     * same decision. The advance multiplies its step by sg_rate only when the actor carries 0x100000
     * and the global KEEP_FPS is asserted, and both halves of that are script-writable at any time.
     * A correction decided anywhere else has to guess which way they will read when the step is
     * finally computed, and Ch_SetMotionSpeed writes a field that never gets reset, so a wrong guess
     * there is permanent. Decided here it lasts one call.
     *
     * The lend is the correction: hand the actor the bit and, where a script has cleared it, the
     * global, let the engine compute the step with its own sg_rate, then put both back. Nothing is
     * computed by the module, which is the point - sg_rate is already right in every case the module
     * would otherwise have to special-case. It is the presented-rate correction in ordinary play,
     * the recorded PS2 frame time while a scene is paced from syncdata, and exactly 1.0 during a
     * catch-up pass, where each extra pass is meant to be a full 30 Hz step.
     *
     * Both writes are safe to make around this one call because it is serial. The advance has one
     * call site, inline in Ch_CalcMain's third loop over the actor table, on the calling thread; the
     * job threads that loop dispatches run the per-element appliers, not the advance. Sg_GetKeepFps
     * has four callers in the image and the advance is the only one that can run inside this window.
     *
     * Actors on the 0x40 path are left alone. That branch has no sg_rate term at all, so lending
     * changes nothing there, and it still runs at the presented rate.
     *
     * The hold is the alternative and the only option that leaves the actor's own fields alone. On a
     * held frame the call is not made, which reproduces the 30 Hz call sequence exactly rather than
     * scaling the step - what a scene that counts animation frames rather than time was authored
     * against. It costs a pose that updates at 30 Hz inside a 60 Hz scene, so it is off by default
     * and takes precedence over the lend when it is on; running both would correct twice.
     *
     * Skipping the call also skips the copy at the end of it, which pulls three joint rotations from
     * an actor's owner into a weapon model in the w061 to w065 range. That copy is a plain overwrite
     * with no accumulation and the next call that does happen rewrites all of it, so the cost is the
     * same one frame of staleness the rest of the held actor already carries. */
