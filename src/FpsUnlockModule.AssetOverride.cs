///     Loose files that win over the VBF, without touching the 20.7 GB archive.
///
///     The engine already loads loose files. Its fios open asks <c>BigFileStream::openFile</c>
///     first, and only when that returns null does it call <c>CreateFileW</c> on the relative path
///     - keeping the two results side by side as <c>handle_vbf</c> and <c>handle_os</c>. The
///     existence probe has the same shape around <c>checkExists</c>. So an override needs no
///     archive surgery and no patched fall-through: it needs the archive to say no.
///
///     <para>The path keeps its authored case and its <c>../../../</c> prefix.</para> The tolower
///     and the separator rewrite in that function run on a second, narrow buffer; the wide buffer
///     <c>CreateFileW</c> receives is converted from the caller's string untouched, and the
///     engine's own trace confirms the shape as
///     <c>../../../FFX_Data/GameData/PS3Data/Video/OPL_us.webm</c>. The prefix never reaches the
///     filesystem - the archive registers as the bare <c>data\FFX_Data.vbf</c> and opens - so it is
///     stripped here rather than resolved.
///
///     That is all this does. Both hooks answer "not in the archive" for a path the override tree
///     carries, and the engine's own fallback opens the file. Nothing here fabricates a VFile,
///     which is why the override file has to sit at exactly the relative path the engine asks for
///     rather than in a folder of its own: <c>CreateFileW</c> receives that path unchanged and
///     resolves it against the process working directory, which is the game directory by the time
///     any asset is opened. It is not the game directory while this module initialises, which is
///     why the tree is indexed from the executable's own directory instead.
///
///     <para>The hooks are not installed when there is nothing to override.</para> They sit on the
///     path every single file open takes, so a run with an empty override tree pays nothing at all
///     rather than paying a detour per file. When there is something, the cost is one
///     case-insensitive dictionary lookup.
///
///     <para>Both targets are measured thiscall.</para> 412 and 204 bytes, each ending in
///     <c>ret 4</c> - one stack argument, <c>this</c> in ecx - and each opening with the security
///     cookie prologue. The catalog calls checkExists <c>__stdcall</c> with one parameter, which is
///     its blanket default and wrong in the convention.
