///     The two frame-bound counters inside the motion path that sg_rate does not reach.
///
///     The rate correction in the motion advance multiplies one thing: the accumulator step. Neither
///     the cross-fade length nor the sequence VM's wait ever sees it, so both count raw calls and
///     both run twice as fast at 60 Hz whether or not the actor is engine-corrected. That is why
///     these two are held for every actor rather than gated on the 0x100000 flag the speed scaling
///     is gated on - the flag decides whether the engine corrects the step, and the step is not what
///     is wrong here.
///
///     Both corrections are the same shape: let the original run, then undo its decrement on the
///     frames a 30 Hz sequence would not have advanced.
